Tom Sachs: OK. So welcome back to the shop, ladies and gentlemen, I got this gift from Nino Wiener at Taschen and look at this motherfucker, The NASA Archives.

Tom Sachs: And you know there are a lot of NASA books out there, but. This is by Pierce Bizony and Andrew Chaikin and Doctor Roger. Launius, I mean, these are like Chaikin wrote the only Penguin book on the space program, and it's like it's must. Bizony wrote the the book on the 2001 special effects man. These are. These are good guys, so let's see what does it take?

Tom Sachs: This is a big book, you know, I love these big beautiful art books, but they are a fucking pain in the ass to store. But sometimes the really great ones are worth it and I Hope I hope I hope I hope. They didn't fuck this up.

Tom Sachs: Let's see.

Tom Sachs: Whoa.

Tom Sachs: Oh it smells. It's got that new sneakers smell. Still big. Right, let's see.

Tom Sachs: Turn this sideways so that. You guys can turn it sideways too, so that it makes sense for viewing. Right? Yeah, big big big kids you can you. Can handle it. Let's see what's going on. OK.

Tom Sachs: Stars.

Tom Sachs: Armstrong's foot, so screen so.

Tom Sachs: The NASA Archives. Let's see this book. Is this book worth it? Oh yeah, these are beautiful pictures.

Tom Sachs: Nothing. I got curiosity.

Tom Sachs: Well, at the top of the LEM while it's still docked inside the connecting ring.

Tom Sachs: That's the London Killer V2.

Tom Sachs: Historical stuff.

Tom Sachs: Oh, this looks great.

Tom Sachs: This is pretty cool. This is in Cleveland, OH. I once went to the Sandusky high power facility where they have the Super vacuum vacuum within a vacuum. It's a pretty cool place.

Tom Sachs: X1. The first supersonic. Beautiful. Oh look at that crash.

Tom Sachs: Wow OK this is this looks like a good book.

Tom Sachs: SR71 like the last one. They gonna cancel the SR-71. The last one that they that they got that was used was the NASA had one for Hypersonic research, like Mach three. Fastest plane ever. So when they can't, when they can't use a surveillance thing, there's one of these on top of the Intrepid, and there's a camera underneath. I guess it became obsolete because of ICBM's and satellites, but that's a cool plane it's all titanium. Anyway, that when they ended it NASA had the last one, they had it going for an extra year.

Tom Sachs: Oh Goddard my boy.

Tom Sachs: The Sputnik. The weather balloons.

Tom Sachs: Wow, Annie Easley a human computer. I think they made a movie about her. And her crew. At some moments.

Tom Sachs: This is like this is the Jack Parsons Explorer one. This is a JPL rocket.

Tom Sachs: Maybe after Jack Parsons, but I like the idea that you know he got his recipes for the Rockets from Satan. Maybe that's him? Or is it Adam Steltzner? Kind of looks like him I wonder who's that? Little hole.

Tom Sachs: I don't know what that fucking thing is.

Tom Sachs: Yeah, This Is This Is This is juicy.

Tom Sachs: Reentry. Lounging.

Tom Sachs: Gene Kranz, do we get to see his white vest?

Tom Sachs: Florida

Tom Sachs: That's like the Polaroid that Joanne Casolo gave me last night in Dallas. Thanks Joanne, that was great to see you. You look fabulous.

Tom Sachs: Gemini.

Tom Sachs: Woah

Tom Sachs: NASA tried to invent a storable and deployable wing system for bring capsules home on land rather than at sea. Inflatable glider deployed from the capsules nose section was one concept. A paraglider. Woah, what like it would glide back to? Land? Or? Why would they just have it land over land?

Tom Sachs: Woah.

Tom Sachs: This is my favorite thing ever. Lifting body. This is always at the beginning of I dream of Jeannie, which is the only good thing about that stupid show. But that the test pilot flew this, and this is kind of like the prototype structurally for the space shuttle where they like the the body itself, sort of became the wing or the lifting force of the craft.

Tom Sachs: For Waldron. Great alright. I'm only on page. Oh, so there's some weird numbering system. 1033

Tom Sachs: Yeah, look at that. You guys enjoying Friday night with Instagram and Me? I certainly am. Nowhere else I'd rather be. I have to move more quickly. We gotta get home.

Tom Sachs: Surveyor.

Tom Sachs: Flying bedstead.

Tom Sachs: Oh, look at that cool simulator.

Tom Sachs: Thomas Demand did a great paper sculpture of this and took photos of it. That's one of my favorite things that he's done. He's a cool artist.

Tom Sachs: I don't want to spend more time with this book.

Tom Sachs: Dave Scott

Tom Sachs: How cool is that red helmet in the middle of all this? This is when they were experimenting. I think it was Red, because what they're going to come back to in case they crash back on them into the water.

Tom Sachs: Margaret Hamilton

Tom Sachs: All this stuff is really inspirational to me and my space program 'cause they had to do everything on Earth. So I mean they had so little time on the moon they spent all their time practicing, and that's what that's what you do. It's more practice than anything. You have a few moments or performance.

Tom Sachs: Mega Chevy photo-op. Each of the astronauts gets their own vet.

Tom Sachs: The Rover. With the earth tires.

Tom Sachs: I love that. Leave it to Taschen to give you full bunch of pages just on the car. I mean, that's appreciation for what makes America great right there. This custom fiberglass folders. Folding fenders. I mean corrugated fiberglass. Corrugated phenolic fenders.

Tom Sachs: Huh?

Tom Sachs: We made those out of glass. They were a real pain.

Tom Sachs: Oh, the Safire speech about men being stuck on the moon. This is great.

Tom Sachs: I'm not gonna read it right now.

Tom Sachs: Color chart photo grayscale.

Tom Sachs: And then skip ahead a little bit.

Tom Sachs: Yeah, I mean all this stuff about all these pictures of earth from outer space are still so important. They really never get corny. This is some art.

Tom Sachs: Camera which guy put this on the moon? He left it up his family. Um? Charlie Duke deliberately dropped the photo on the ground with his family in their Texas backyard. Snapshot is certainly faded by now. From the glare of the sun, but this photograph is preserved in Houston's temperature controlled environments. This the photograph of the photograph, right? It's kinda cool.

Tom Sachs: I'd like to see this faded flag and what condition that's in. Maybe someone can go get that and bring it back for me. I would really appreciate it. Oh Russia, USA docking adapter. They had no. Male probe usually there's a male and female probe on both ends had the same capturing docking assemblies, and it was kind of like a political joint and there was a. There's a handshake in the middle. Tom Stoppard and Alexei Leonov I think did the handshake at the height of the Cold War. So cool that we could do this big stupid art project in the middle of like the most scariest times of like impending nuclear annihilation.

Tom Sachs: Founded in 2010, the sequel at 2001, 2010, about going, I guess back to Europa. There was this kind of a redo of that anxiety of the Cold War, but the aliens saved the saved Planet Earth. Previous job here now.

Tom Sachs: Wow and then looks like they're getting into the shuttle, so this might be a time for me to sign off. 'cause like, seriously, who cares? About the fucking shuttle.

Tom Sachs: Oh, tragedy.

Tom Sachs: Just go really quickly and see if there's some cool shit

Tom Sachs: Space station stuff.

Tom Sachs: The cupola isn't that beautiful that room. 'cause that's the best.

Tom Sachs: Canadarm.

Tom Sachs: The Russians still come down on land. And they're met by horses. Look at that. It's like Vermont.

Tom Sachs: Oh Sexy. I mean who took that picture? It's like an Art photograph. Look at that. Like William Christenberry or someone. It's that good. Michael Benson. Oh this book's got so much. I'm halfway through. Just for those of you turning in tuning in, we're we're taking a look at the new The NASA archives Taschen Book

Tom Sachs:  Oh, hot Carl. Steven Brauer told me that Carl This Is This is Viking on, not on Mars obviously, but unlike sort of fake Mars and he was one of the main scientists on this and he really want to this is the first thing that landed Mars and picked up samples with this arm and sent data back. And this is a camera and he really wanted to put bait. Bacon on it to see if an if creatures would come but they they kind of voted him out. But that's hot Carl right there. Thanks for trying Carl.

Tom Sachs: Woah, what is that? Is that Mars? It's Probably Mars. This is gotta all be Mars stuff.

Tom Sachs: Next Pathfinder. Woah, is that Pathfinder or is it spirit and opportunity? It's gotta be spirit and opportunity.

Tom Sachs: Phoenix.

Tom Sachs: Wow. So many good things here.

Tom Sachs: What is that? What planet is that? Pluto? That is such a good photo. I didn't know that we had pictures that good of Pluto.

Tom Sachs: Where are these?

Tom Sachs: Satolas

Tom Sachs: Apple, the earth so good.

Tom Sachs: See if we got some Europa.

Tom Sachs: Wow.

Tom Sachs: Oh yeah, this thing we're going to fuck with this thing. What is this thing? Oh artist impression. Of. ʻOumuamua discovered on October 9th, 2017 by the Pan-STARRS, one telescope in Hawaii. Sounds good observations from other telescopes around the world. Prove that it drifted through space for millions of years before its chance encounter with our solar system. ʻOumuamua seems to be a dark, highly long gated metal rich object. 1300 feet long because of its unusual shape, it was checked for any. Strange radio signals or other energies, but none were observed. Maybe we need to go there and see if we can get some stuff to fix our cell phones. 'cause we're running out of. Things were mining out of Africa and haven't we fucked with that place enough? Let's go to some asteroids and see if we can find some cell phone parts there.

Tom Sachs: Yeah. Alright, well. My review is definitely get it.

Tom Sachs: Oh, it's got all these mission patches. That's pretty cool.

Tom Sachs: But. While were at it, will just look at some other space books in my space library. And of course this library has been gaped of all the best stuff. Because all the good things always get given away. But. If you are really into space, I would highly encourage that you get.

Tom Sachs: Um. Let’s see. This is cool for learning about stars curious george. That’s a really great book, makes it simple, a new way to see em because it’s confusing and hard and frustrating. Still for me, I'm not a great astronomer.

Tom Sachs: Um. I would definitely get the December 1969 national geographic. Ah. Expensive.

Tom Sachs: Um. Get the Penguin book that Andrew Chaikin wrote. Um. I dunno. I think it’s called all went do do. Or man on the moon or all we do is go to the moon or man on the moon? Anyway just Andrew Chaikin Penguin is how you find that.

Tom Sachs: Um. This is not the bible. But it’s a pretty damn good book and when we built the LEM you see it’s on a chain with a sash weight because it kept getting stolen. J.J Pete did that, it’s really got all the parts so you can really learn about the LEM here. Again not great but probably the best book there is.

Tom Sachs: Um. This is mandatory, I have three copies of it. Best book, the only credible book on um space suits. By Nicholas De Monchaux called fashioning Apollo. I mean this is really it. Nicholas is a great writer, a brilliant man and this is my research copy with all kinds of things stuck in it.

Tom Sachs: Um. After I made my space suits, but I’m putting this down for a second. Um. That’s really good. This is kinda of a fun one. This book if you’re really into space suits. By Amanda young who was the kinda great archivst of the space suits whose retired but that’s her swan song. But that book’s really good to on Space Suits.

Tom Sachs: Ah. Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic book about loneliness. Um. This is Michael Collins wrote this kids book. I swear I know it maybe looks like I had something to do with it. I didn’t. But look at these drawings. I had nothing to do with this, but man this is great. Michael Collins was the guy when Buz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the surface of the moon he was the one who stayed in the command module, circling the moon waiting for them to come back and uh. This is a really great book talking about loneliness to kids. This has got a very good message about humility and strength so it’s really great.

Tom Sachs: I would definitely get this um NASA graphics standard manual, which has got everything you need to making your stationary or pantone color chips. Right? This is uh. This is uh really really great or if you are painting your jet or your rocketship it’s got the official codes and dials and how to do it. Vehicles. Yeah. Vehicles section seven, let’s see if I can get this right. Yeah. So if you’re painting like the door of your van this is how you deal with the logotype. This is really worth. Yeah. So if you’re doing your valiant or your econoline but they also have it for your rockets and stuff but I love it that they put all the vehicles together in one section. Van or this is a really rare book, there you got all your planes and stuff. Blue stripe. Anyway. They hired a madison avenue firm in 1976 to design it and you should definitely. This is like an original but you could reprinted it and you can get it, it’s out there um. Graphics standards manual. Mandatory.

Tom Sachs: Um. Let’s see. Oh. Fuck yeah. This is the other best book, the only other book worth reading about the moon mission is Norman Mailer’s of a fire on the moon. This is great and I think this is going to be coming out again pretty soon. That’s Mandatory. Mailer and Chaikin are the only good writers, I mean of course everything Sagan’s great but you know. That’s big science. Oh Michael Light wrote the best book on the moon. It’s all NASA photographs that he took from the archives and reprinted. That’s great but I’m not pulling it out, but that’s a must.

Tom Sachs: Um. These are all really really really really good. These are all just downloaded and printed. Reports off the moon. Um. Off the internet. I’d get the Apollo 11 press kit. That’s worth getting reprinted. This is a pretty old one, it’s one of the first things that started my space program. Press Kit. I don’t think this is an original, I think it’s a reprint, but I’ve had it for years but it’s got everything you need to know about what it takes to go to the moon is in the press kit. Look at that. They typed this fucker up reffed it and sent it out. These are some of um, this is just a binder of all my lunar rover development oh wait. My lunar rover development and their lunar rover development and this is there operations handbook that I printed out. LEM orientation, that’s a good report. Um. So I think that’s a pretty good Friday night. Um. Lot of bad books, but where not going to talk about them, but you never know where your gonna find something good. So uh, um. Yup. Keep your ah. Keep your dick in a vice. End of Transmission.
