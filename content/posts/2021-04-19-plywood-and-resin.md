## TRANSCRIPT

{{< jump "00:00:00">}} Tom Sachs: iD magazine June 2021. Check it out. Look we got a whole spread and were going to make a zine out of this. Here goes.

{{< jump "00:00:56">}} Tom Sachs: So now I have all the pages to the zine in the proper order. My front cover, everything in the middle, and then my back cover.

{{< jump "00:01:04">}} Tom Sachs: Now I'm gonna collate, so I take the back cover and the front cover off and tape them together.

{{< jump "00:01:20">}} Tom Sachs: So tape over the edge and then flip it over and tape both sides. Important to tape both sides.

{{< jump "00:01:36">}} Tom Sachs: Then you tape over the edges again. Corners. Now you have the first page, second page, last page and second last page.

{{< jump "00:01:48">}} Tom Sachs: Do this for the rest of the pages and make sure they are in the correct order. This is the centerfold. Pro Tip: Buy a second copy for reference.

{{< jump "00:02:00">}} Tom Sachs: Final step: binding. Use embroidery thread.

{{< jump "00:02:06">}} Tom Sachs: So right through the middle. Ow. Use a thimble.

{{< jump "00:02:27">}} Tom Sachs: Pro Tip Number two: end your last stitch on the inside so your knot is on the inside so their protected for a cleaner appearance.

{{< jump "00:02:36">}} Tom Sachs: Overhand knot. Snug it again.
