description: Tom Sachs unboxes a silk screen print of Too Darn Hot and tours the inbuilt authentication systems.

nuggets:
- Flip it over so any contaminants that are on top don't retouch it when you put it back.
- So this is a silk screen on heavy pretentious art paper. 
- So we've got a notary public style debossing. There's this code here, this little bit of UV ink.

{{< jump "00:00:00">}} Tom Sachs: I just got a advance copy, so I'm gonna open it and show you what it looks like.

{{< jump "00:00:09">}} Tom Sachs: When you open it, you move the whole print to one side and then you hinge it open like that. 

{{< jump "00:00:19">}} Tom Sachs: In here are the important documents, let's see what's inside. 

{{< jump "00:00:23">}} Tom Sachs: Scan this QR code, and yours will be a unique QR code taking you to a place on the blockchain where you can attach your wallet. The certificate of authenticity is stored posterity on the block chain.

{{< jump "00:00:37">}} Tom Sachs: Putting it back in there so no one can see it. 

{{< jump "00:00:39">}} Tom Sachs: I'm putting on the gloves.

{{< jump "00:00:48">}} Tom Sachs: Take this off.

{{< jump "00:00:51">}} Tom Sachs: Grab it gently. Underneath and break the seal. So you kinda tear it.

{{< jump "00:01:00">}} Tom Sachs: See.

{{< jump "00:01:02">}} Tom Sachs: Then you can slide the print out. Gently. Keep em' so you can reattach it. 

{{< jump "00:01:09">}} Tom Sachs: Last seam comes off.

{{< jump "00:01:16">}} Tom Sachs: Flip it over so any contaminants that are on top don't retouch it when you put it back.

{{< jump "00:01:20">}} Tom Sachs: Now you can see the print.

{{< jump "00:01:22">}} Tom Sachs: So this is a silk screen on heavy pretentious art paper. 

{{< jump "00:01:29">}} Tom Sachs: So we've got a notary public style debossing. There's this code here, this little bit of UV ink. 

{{< jump "00:01:37">}} Tom Sachs: That's a QR code and that'll take you to the place on the blockchain with the metadata for the Too Darn Hot rocket that was launched at LACMA earlier this year. 

{{< jump "00:01:51">}} Tom Sachs: Then. Turn it over. Back we've got a hologram sticker, if you try to peel it off, it'll self-destruct. And the QR code which matches the QR code on this piece of paper which brings you to the place on the blockchain were you've got the authentication stored in posterity. And these two match.

{{< jump "00:02:13">}} Tom Sachs: This is a twenty four hour mint window. That means it's available for twenty four hours and twenty four hours only. And that begins November second at one pm eastern time. It ends twenty four hours later, November third at one pm eastern time. So we're making as many of these prints as you decide.
